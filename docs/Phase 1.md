# Phase 1 Deliverables

## Project Summary
Our project is to develop a HaaS platform where users can rent hardware resources and be charged for the time they use. This platform should also allow them to create accounts so that they can have a unique experience across the site. The users will then be able to create projects, which can then be associated with different hardware sets if they are available. Lastly, users should be able to download and view datasets on their local machines so that they can preview the data that they would potentially use in their project.

## User Stories
The user stories can be found [here](https://github.com/JimothyGreene/EE461L-Group2-FinalProject/projects/4), or in the **Projects** tab then **Tasks**.

## Tools
- For our **backend**, we chose to use **Python Flask**
- For our **frontend**, we chose to use **React**
- For our **database**, we chose to use **MongoDB**
- For **deployment**, we will use Google Cloud
- We also chose to use **Docker** for containerization to help manage environment versions and dependency issues during development. It also allows us to easily deploy the container images to the cloud and utilize GitHub actions for CI/CD
